# Movie Recommender System
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System project! This project is designed to help users discover new movies based on their given movie name. It uses the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, which contains information about thousands of movies, including their titles, genres, user ratings, and more. By analyzing this data, we can provide personalized movie recommendations to users.
